# dommanipulation
This was a small project I worked on while working through Andrei Neagoie's ZTM course. 
The goal was to create a Background Generator by manipulating the DOM. Clicking the "Randomizer" button will generate two random colors for the gradient background. Or, you can select your own two colors using the two RGBA selectors. Additionally, the CSS properties will be displayed on the screen.
